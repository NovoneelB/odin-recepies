            <p>Bánh mì translates literally to “bread” in Vietnamese and is well-known today as a Vietnamese street food sandwich.
               The modern day bánh mì sandwich stemmed from French colonialism in Vietnam when French cuisine heavily influenced 
               Vietnamese food culture. After the French defeat, Vietnamese cooks adapted a popular French sandwich made with cold 
               cuts, butter, and cheese into what we recognize today as bánh mì. They incorporated rice flour into the baguette recipe, 
               which produced a lighter interior and paper-thin crust. Mayonnaise replaced butter and veggies and pâté 
               replaced expensive cold cuts.
